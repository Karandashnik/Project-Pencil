Meet Jot!

Jot is an intuitive scheduling application for small businesses.  The current build is for a private school offering before and after school childcare.  We are in the process of expanding its application to serve a variety of small businesses.

Users can securely create an account and login with either Facebook or locally.
Then they can add their kids to the list of enrollees and make, modify and see appointments on our interactive calendar.
